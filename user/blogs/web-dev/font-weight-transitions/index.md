#### Fixing jarring font-weight animation

Welcome to my first blog post! [svelte-QWER](https://github.com/kwchang0831/svelte-QWER), the project powering my blog, uses CSS transitions on the blog post titles (shown below), but the font was not transitioning smoothly between 100 and 900 font weight. I think the author did not use a variable font, so that's what I'll be adding.

Here's are two articles on using variable fonts on the web from CSS-Tricks:

- [One File, Many Options: Using Variable Fonts on theÂ Web](https://css-tricks.com/one-file-many-options-using-variable-fonts-web/)
- [#259: How to use variable fonts](https://css-tricks.com/newsletter/259-how-to-use-variable-fonts/)

It took me a while to figure out how to use them and get a single .woff2 file from Google Fonts, so I guess I'm also writing this as reference for the future.

:::caution

Make sure to include `font-weight: 100 900;` inside `@font-face`. This specifies the range that is supported by the font and is _required_ for font-weight transitions. Without this, the font-weight may not show in Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers (based on my observations).

#### Locally host variable font from Google Fonts

1. Choose a variable font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?vfonly=true)
2. Convert ttf file to woff2. I use [CloudConvert](https://cloudconvert.com/ttf-to-woff2)
3. Add font in stylesheets (shown below using this blog's font as an example):

```css
/// showLineNumber
@font-face {
    font-family: "Commissioner";
    font-weight: 100 900;
    src: url("../fonts/Commissioner-VariableFont_wght.woff2") format("woff2-variations");
}

:root {
  font-family: "Commissioner", sans-serif;
}
```

#### Using CSS transitions on font-weight

```css
h1 {
    font-weight: 100;
    transition: font-weight 0.25s;
}

h1:hover {
    font-weight: 900;
}
```

Thanks for reading!
